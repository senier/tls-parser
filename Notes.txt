* Issue

Extensions in Client Hello are not represented as the (Length,Data) format of
the variable-length arrays used elsewhere in RFC5246. Instead the presence of
Extensions is signaled by the fact that there are still bytes over in
ClientHello after reading in its other elements.

This is impossible to implement as pure 'Read operation, as there is no way to
pass the overall length of the packet determined in the 'Read operation of the
Handshake message down to the 'Read operation of its component of type
ClientHello.  Also, a custom 'Read operation for ClientHello would need to
collect the lengths of the other (non-Extension) components and pass the
remaining bytes down to the 'Read operation of the Extensions element to
determine whether there is space for Extensions.

* Idea

Only use 'Read attribute for basic types. For composite types implement an
analogous operation that manually constructs the objects by calling a custom
read operation on all components. These operations would could have a parameter
to pass in the remaining bytes.
